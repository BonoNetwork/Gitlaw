# GitLaw Repository

GitLaw is a global version control system for laws and regulations. The purpose of this repository is to track and version legal texts from various jurisdictions, including countries, supranational entities, network states, and international organizations. The repository leverages Git to maintain version integrity, allowing users to see changes, amendments, and additions to legal texts over time.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into several main sections to accommodate different types of legal entities:

- **`regions/`**: Contains legal texts for countries organized by geographical regions. The regions are:

  - `Africa`
  - `Asia`
  - `Europe`
  - `North_America`
  - `South_America`
  - `Oceania`
  - `Antarctica`

  Each region contains subdirectories for countries, represented by their ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes (e.g., `USA` for the United States).

- **`supranational_entities/`**: Contains legal texts for entities that transcend national boundaries, such as:

  - `EU` (European Union)
  - `UN` (United Nations)
  - `BRICS` (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa)
  - `ASEAN` (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)

- **`network_states/`**: Contains governance documents for emerging digital or decentralized communities (e.g., `NetworkState1`).

- **`organizations/`**: Contains legal frameworks, standards, or guidelines produced by international organizations, such as:

  - `ISO` (International Organization for Standardization)
  - `IEEE` (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)
  - `ICANN` (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)

## Metadata Files

Each directory contains a `metadata.yaml` file that provides information about the entity, such as:

- **Country or Entity Name**
- **ISO Codes** (for countries and territories)
- **Region**
- **Administrative Divisions**
- **Notes** (e.g., for disputed territories)

## Future Plans

- **Automated Updates**: Implement a system to automatically fetch and update legal texts from official government and organizational websites.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Integrate with blockchain to provide an immutable record of changes to the legal texts.
- **AI Integration**: Utilize AI to help users navigate and understand changes in laws across different jurisdictions.
